<strong>VERSE 1</strong>

  Em                                                      
I jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire because
  Am7
I thought I was afraid of the heat.
    D7sus4          D7            D9                    D7         
But now I find it's hot out here, things become so very clear
     Em7                Em6            EmaddC Em
When flames are licking right at your feet.
Em                Am                C                    D7
Tell me where the people take their sorrows when they're alone.
Em                 Am                 C              D7
Show me where this place is where the sun has never shone.

<strong>CHORUS</strong>

                         Em          EmaddG               Am7 Am7addG
'Caus I don't believe in hopelessness, I won't accept the loneliness.
     D7            D7sus4  D7     D9 D7 Em   
No I don't believe hope is really ever gone.
                 Em           EmaddG           Am7        Am7addG
We all deserve a second chance, don't accept a bad romance,
     D7                       D7Sus4    D7       D9 D7  Em
your heart will know, if it's time that you were moving on.
    B7                             Em
And remember, hope is never really gone.

<strong>VERSE 2</strong>

Em                                                  
Take my hand I'll lead you to the edge of this cliff
            Am7
And we will peer into the ocean below.
    D7sus4             D7        
But now we're perched upon the edge,
D9                  D7              Em7           Em6       EmaddC Em
can you still stick to your pledge, throw it all away and let go?
Em                Am               C                 D7
Tell me what's so painful that you cannot bear to survive,
Em            Am                C                       D7
Listen when I tell you that the pain just shows you're alive.

<strong>CHORUS</strong>

                   Em          EmaddG               Am7       Am7addG
I don't believe in hopelessness, I won't accept the loneliness.
     D7            D7sus4  D7     D9 D7 Em   
No I don't believe hope is really ever gone.
                 Em           EmaddG           Am7        Am7addG
We all deserve a second chance, don't accept a bad romance,
     D7                       D7Sus4    D7       D9 D7  Em
your heart will know, if it's time that you were moving on.
    B7                             Em
And remember, hope is never really gone.

<strong>VERSE 3</strong>

Em                                                                          
Raise your head and look around, enjoy the sights absorb the sounds,
        Am7
There's beauty and there's wonder to see.
      D7sus4       D7               D9                    D7                 
Don't ever tell me you are bored if there are things that you've
           Em7               Em6        EmaddC Em  
ignored in mountains and the rivers and trees.
Em           Am                       C               D7
Open up your eyes and tell me there's nothing left to see.
Em           Am              C             D7
You can criticise and fuel despair with apathy.

<strong>CHORUS</strong>

                       Em          EmaddG               Am7   Am7addG
But I don't believe in hopelessness, I won't accept the loneliness.
     D7            D7sus4  D7     D9 D7 Em   
No I don't believe hope is really ever gone.
                 Em           EmaddG           Am7        Am7addG
We all deserve a second chance, don't accept a bad romance,
     D7                       D7Sus4    D7       D9 D7  Em
your heart will know, if it's time that you were moving on.
    B7                             Em
And remember, hope is never really gone.
