<strong>Verse 1</strong>

C            G                    Am
It's been a year now, feels like yesterday, where does it all go?
C       G                     Em              F
We were sat outside, you were drinking vodka in the snow.
   C   G       Am         C   G   Am
It fee-eels so cold and I nee-eed you to hold.

C             G                 Am
It breaks my heart to know you hurt inside and I feel it too.
           G                     Em               F
But when a state of mind is your prison cell what can I do?
          C      G  Am              C   G     Am
When your life's on hold 'caus it's not like you've been told.

<strong>Chorus</strong>

Em                             F                                       C
The angels sleep inside their souls tonight, there's nowhere else hide.
            ?         Am                                G
The thunder roars the rain it bites, it's going to be a long one
                            F                        C
if you don't share with someone what causes all that pain
G              Am
 to haunt you again.

<strong>Verse 2</strong>

C        G                Am
Life and love they can be hard to live, when you really care.
C             G                   Em                    F
You've got so much to give, you'd make it work if you'd only dare
        C        G        Am          C    G       Am
See yourself for what you are, you've only seen so far.

C             G                Am
You think you see your face in other's eyes, but what about your own?
C        G            Em               F
What you feel inside about yourself is all you've shown.
         C   G  Am            C    G   Am
And it's all so wrong, you've felt bad far too long.

<strong>Chorus</strong>

Em                             F                                       C
The angels sleep inside their souls tonight, there's nowhere else hide.
            ?         Am                                G
The thunder roars the rain it bites, it's going to be a long one
                            F                        C
if you don't share with someone what causes all that pain
G              Am
 to haunt you again.
