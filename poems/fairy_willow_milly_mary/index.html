      <h1>Fairy Willow Milly Mary</h1>
      <small>by Ben Francis 2012</small>

<p>Fairy Willow Milly Mary was a happy soul,<br />
with eyes as blue as forget-me-nots and hair that shone like gold.<br />
She liked to play in flower beds and chase the butterflies,<br />
on lazy summer afternoons with cloudless clear blue skies.</p>

<p>One morning as she sat upon a toadstool red and white,<br />
she heard a gentle sobbing sound and saw an awful sight.<br />
For underneath an apple tree there was a little girl,<br />
with tears running down her face and twigs stuck in her curls.</p>

<p>Fairy Willow Milly Mary fluttered to her side,<br />
and as she whispered in her ear her eyes did open wide.<br />
"Please don't cry o' human child, it makes me very sad,<br />
if you could smile and dry your eyes I would be very glad."</p>

<p>The little girl she sat up straight, eyes darting all around,<br />
looking for the little voice that made this little sound.<br />
Willow fluttered through the air and landed on her hand,<br />
the little girl just sat and stared, she could not understand.</p>

<p>"Please tell me what has made you cry, and get in such a state,<br />
is there something I can do, or is it far too late?"<br />
Although the girl thought it odd to speak in such a way,<br />
to a person perched upon her hand, she thought it seemed okay...</p>

<p>"The other girls were teasing me and pushed me in a bush."<br />
the little girl said sheepishly and then began to blush.<br />
"Now they will not play with me and have left me all alone,<br />
that is why I'm sitting here, crying on my own."</p>

<p>"What a horrid thing to do, I'm not surprised you're sad!<br />
If I was pushed into a bush, I would be very mad.<br />
But don't you see, you're not alone, for everywhere you look,<br />
there are fairies hidden in the garden, in every cranny and nook."</p>

<p>With those words she reached into a pouch hung by her side,<br />
and blew some sparkling fairy dust into the girl's teary eyes.<br />
It made her sneeze and rub her face, but when she looked again,<br />
she couldn't quite believe her eyes at what she saw just then.</p>

<p>For everywhere that she looked, little people danced,<br />
but seemed to sort of disappear the moment that she glanced.<br />
They had pretty wings and plaited hair and held long daisy chains.<br />
They laughed and sang and danced around as they played their little games.</p>

<p>"So now you know that when you're sad, you never are alone,<br />
for fairies always can be found wherever flowers grow."<br />
With this thought the little girl smiled a happy smile,<br />
and sat beneath the apple tree, just watching for a while.</p>
